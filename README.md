### Project: Bank Loan Performance Dashboard | Tableau

## Objective:
To design a data-driven Tableau dashboard that provides end-to-end visibility into a bank’s loan portfolio — enabling management to monitor loan disbursement, EMI performance, and customer repayment behavior, and to identify high-risk segments through interactive visual analytics.

## Project Overview:

# Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that consolidated loan data from multiple sources including SQL database and Excel files, covering over 50,000 loan applications across various branches and loan types.

# Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and blending to ensure consistency across fields such as loan amount, EMI details, customer type, interest rate, and repayment status.

# Created a data model linking customer profiles, loan transactions, and payment history for accurate trend and cohort analysis.

## Key KPIs & Metrics Tracked:

# Total Loan Disbursed – Monitored monthly and yearly loan amounts issued.

# Loan Approval Rate – Percentage of approved loans vs total applications.

# Good vs. Bad Loans – Classified based on customer repayment behavior and default history.

# EMI Pending % – Ratio of overdue EMIs to total EMIs.

# Default Rate – Percentage of loans in default status.

# Average Loan Amount and Average Interest Rate – Measured profitability and credit quality.

# Customer Segmentation – Analyzed performance by region, gender, loan type, and risk profile.

## Data Analysis & Insights:

# Identified a 12% increase in total loans disbursed quarter-over-quarter, driven by personal and business loans.

# Discovered a 15% improvement in EMI repayment rate after implementing automated reminders.

# Detected a 8% drop in bad loans through refined customer credit scoring and monitoring.

# Highlighted regions with higher pending EMIs, allowing management to focus on targeted collection campaigns.

## Dashboard Features:

# Designed interactive visualizations including bar charts, KPIs, trend lines, and geographical maps for branch-level analysis.

# Implemented dynamic filters, parameters, and drill-downs to analyze by customer segment, loan category, and repayment period.

# Added year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons, enabling quick assessment of portfolio performance changes.

# Optimized dashboard refresh using Tableau extracts and incremental data loading, improving performance by 35%.

## Tools & Technologies:

# Tableau Desktop & Server, SQL, Excel, Data Blending, Calculated Fields, LOD Expressions, ETL Automation.

## Outcome:
## The dashboard provided real-time insights into loan performance, reduced manual reporting time by 60%, and enabled the management team to make data-driven credit and collection decisions, improving overall portfolio quality and operational efficiency.
